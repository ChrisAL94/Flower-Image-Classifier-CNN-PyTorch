# Flower-Image-Classifier-CNN-PyTorch
*Repository for a Flower Classification using CNN (Framework: PyTorch)*

## Project Overview
In this project I use deep learning with PyTorch to make an image classifier that predicts the top K flower classes and their associated probabilities from a picture.

## Data
This project uses the 102 Category Flower Dataset from the University of Oxford. It consist of 102 categories of flowers, each containing 40 to 258 images.

## Software and Libraries

This project uses the following software and Python libraries:

* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-364/)
* [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
